        <p><a href="#1" class="day" id="1"></a>I woke up illuminated by the strong, white lights above me.</p>
        <p>At first, there was nothing. My eyes were glued shut, but the light glowing through my eyelids gave the
            darkness
            a distinct red tint. I imagined it to be just another dream, until I felt the weight of my body pressing
            down on
            something soft--a mattress, I assumed. “Another dream”... I somehow knew I had been dreaming endlessly, but
            couldn’t recall anything. I also couldn’t remember falling asleep at all, but that didn’t really bother
            me--waking up confused is normal, right?</p>
        <p>I opened my eyes, but could not see. Everything was blurry. My focus took a long time to adjust, but at last,
            I
            could see the source of the light: two lamps, long and cylindrical, protected by a rectangular casing. They
            emitted a constant, slightly unnerving buzz, barely audible among the plethora of other sounds around me,
            such
            as the catchy tune from a nearby radio, my heavy breathing under the oxygen mask, and the beeping from the
            heart
            rhythm monitor to the right of my bed.</p>
        <p>Almost as a reflex, I lifted up my head and looked around, in disbelief. That was exactly what it looked
            like: I
            was in a hospital room. Besides the mask, I was also wearing a green-ish gown, from under which various
            wires
            emerged and connected to the monitor as it displayed a regular, repeating pattern, as well as a number
            fluctuating from 60 to 80. They gradually started increasing with every new piece of information I gathered.
            That did not look like a good situation.</p>
        <p>An IV dripped on my left arm, as I discovered, somewhat painfully, by trying to move it. The bag was full,
            definitely replaced recently, but there was no nurse in sight. A blanket covered everything below my waist,
            as
            if hiding it for my own sake, and there were bandages wrapped around my head. Accident, I figured. Great.
            However, I couldn’t remember the details. In fact, I couldn’t remember... well, anything.</p>
        <p>Not even my name.</p>
        <p><a href="#2" class="day" id="2"></a>The number on the monitor quickly rose to 200. My breathing became
            increasingly erratic. It... it didn't make
            sense. I didn’t even have flashes or anything of the sort. There was just... nothing, as my life was a book,
            and
            all of its pages had been torn out. It was like being born again, but unlike a baby, I knew what the things
            around me were. I had a vague idea of what kind of place I was in. And, the most crucial difference, my
            mother
            wasn’t there. Nobody was. I was alone.</p>
        <p>I needed some air. Real air, not the saturated mess coming from the ventilator; my mouth was drier than a
            desert
            and my throat burned in pain. As I violently ripped the mask out, I realised there was something I could
            rely
            on: vague, underlying feelings. For example, I noticed something was wrong with my hair. It was as dark as
            it
            could be, which probably checked out, but its length felt... wrong. I couldn’t tell why. It was just too
            long.
            Bloody hell... for how long had I been-</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I saw something odd. Or, at least, I thought I did. There was no way that was actually real, but it
            very much appeared to me: random strokes of light, at the corner of my vision. They behaved like waves,
            pulsing
            in and out of existence. And as I tried processing them, with every pulse, I slowly started to feel it: an
            excruciating pain building up around my right eye.</p>
        <p>I don’t even know how to describe it properly. Maybe a good approximation would be “if someone sawed your
            head
            open, filled it with razors, and then shook it as hard as they could”. What matters is that it was
            disorienting;
            everything was spinning, I couldn’t stop sweating, and was unable to focus on anything other than the pain
            itself. My breathing was heavy; that made me wonder whether removing the mask caused it. But putting it back
            on
            wouldn’t matter. The lights were too much. The sounds were too much. Everything was too much.</p>
        <p>It got so bad so quickly that I started coughing. At the same time, my throat--still burning, by the
            way--started
            to feel nauseated. I didn’t like where that was going, and needed to act fast. I wasn’t going to drag the
            IV’s
            wheeled stand with me to the bathroom. I looked to my left; there was a small table with all kinds of minor
            medical supplies and tools laid on a metal plate. I instinctively knew what I had to do.</p>
        <p>After struggling to get my right hand to the other side of my body, I reached out to a piece of cotton wool,
            held
            my breath, and started pulling the tape, and then the needle, of the IV. It would have hurt less had I done
            it
            at once instead of hesitating. But, if anything, it was a distraction from the headache.</p>
        <p>Once the cotton wool had stopped the bleeding, with both of my hands now free, I applied a curative to my
            arm,
            turned off the radio--the song was slowly driving me crazy--and uncomfortably removed the sensors glued to
            my
            chest in order to free my body. The beeping flatlined, but I disagreed with the alarming diagnosis. Despite
            being unable to think straight and feeling like I was about to spew my guts out, that was a negative on
            being
            deceased. I hoped, at least.</p>
        <p>With that done, I pulled my torso up, sitting on the bed. There was something funny about the visible
            depression
            my body had left on the mattress and on the pillow, but it also worried me. Again, for how long had I been
            asleep...? No matter. Reaching the nearest toilet was still very much urgent, so, without giving it much
            thought, I removed the bedsheets from my lower body. The shock made me instantly regret it.</p>
        <p>One of my legs... was missing.</p>
        <p><a href="#3" class="day" id="3"></a>Or rather, not missing, but replaced. My left leg was prosthetic, almost
            robotic, with round joints where my
            knee
            and ankle should be. The “foot” was simply a metallic prism. My right leg wasn’t much better, either: it was
            overrun with scars and burn marks. But, to my surprise, I could move both of them. Good enough--no time to
            ponder about what could possibly have caused that. I turned left, reached for the floor with my legs, and
            stood
            up. Too quickly. Everything blacked out for a brief second.</p>
        <p>No matter. I put on the pair of brown sandals that was conveniently lying around and moved forward. Or, at
            least,
            tried to. I could barely walk in my state, but I only needed to drag myself some two metres or so forward
            before
            turning left again and facing the bathroom door. I rushed to the toilet and, at long last, allowed myself to
            throw up. As it turned out, my stomach was already pretty much empty, so I had to stay there, kneeling, as I
            waited for my diaphragm to stop contracting.</p>
        <p>After that terrible experience, the only thing I could think about was taking a shower. Upon undressing,
            however,
            I was displeased to find more scars and burn marks across my lower body. Yikes. The combination of
            sleepiness,
            the headache and the steaming hot water made me hallucinate incoherent thoughts and nearly pass out, but it
            was
            exactly what I needed. After I was done, I put my gown on again. Not exactly hygienic, but I simply didn’t
            find
            anything else to wear.</p>
        <p>I curiously went to face the mirror. Remember: I had literally forgotten my appearance. And, let me tell you,
            I
            was not impressed. I looked like a zombie; my skin was pale and there were two very well defined dark
            circles
            below my eyes. Speaking of eyes, the right one still hurt. A lot. It hurt so much that I impulsively decided
            to
            pick up the bandages I had tossed away when undressing, and instead used them to make an eye patch covering
            it.
            For some reason, I thought that would help. Plus, it looked... kind of cool, actually.</p>
        <p>I stood there staring at myself for an admittedly long time. Something about it fascinated me. Was that
            really
            me? I was having trouble processing all of that. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that it was the hair.
            My
            hair was too damn long. I went back to the bedroom, grabbed a pair of scissors from the medical kit, and
            trimmed
            it short. Very short. You know, to compensate. The result definitely made me feel... lighter, in a literal
            sense, but I was still not convinced by the woman in the mirror who claimed to be me. I confronted her.</p>
        <p>“You,” I said pointing at myself, forcing an expression of distrust, “who are you? What the hell are you
            doing
            here?”</p>
        <p>There was no answer. Deep down, that was an excuse for finding out what my voice sounded like. I then quickly
            snapped back to reality, looking around to make sure nobody saw that. If anyone did, I’d probably be forced
            into
            a straitjacket and sent to the psych ward. At any rate, I was unsure about what to do next. I could, at the
            very
            least, walk properly now, if not limping--can you imagine not feeling one of your legs, but still being able
            to
            control it and having to account for its weight when moving around? It was seriously weird.</p>
        <p>I decided to explore my room. It wasn’t exactly spacious, and was shaped like an “L” surrounding the small
            bathroom annex. The wall to the right of my bed continued beyond it, with a door at the end. The wall across
            that one, shorter due to the bathroom, had a small window. I peeked outside; it wasn’t a particularly sunny
            day.
            There were more windows across a gap that extended several floors down, with no bottom in sight, but that
            was
            it.</p>
        <p>The last wall, directly opposite to me upon waking up, had a small desk. It contained only two items: a
            flower
            pot with purple orchids and a golden crescent moon necklace. Adjacent to it was a chair, facing towards the
            bed.
            The three things felt... familiar, each in its own way. The smell of the orchids would have brought me
            memories,
            if I had any. The chair... I could feel a certain presence coming from it, but couldn’t tell why. And
            wearing
            the necklace just felt right. It was like it was part of me. Plus, no other reason for it to be in my room,
            right?</p>
        <p><a href="#4" class="day" id="4"></a>The flowers were healthy, meaning someone had been watering them. There
            was also the IV bag matter, and the
            room
            looked generally clean. If you’re wondering why I was trying to assure myself that other people existed,
            that’s
            because I noticed a camera had witnessed all of my earlier predicament. You’d expect medical staff to
            intervene
            in case they saw a patient practically forcing herself out of bed. More concerningly, you’d expect someone
            to
            check on a room with an audible, annoying, and unending flatline tone. But nobody came.</p>
        <p>Part of me wondered if this wasn’t just an awfully realistic dream. A lot of things didn’t fit. But, to my
            disappointment, I didn’t gain control over reality upon looking down or anything of the sort. Instead, I
            could
            only see the frail, shaking hands of a scared woman, who was, in fact, me. But I wasn’t even remotely ready
            to
            accept my situation. I needed answers, and I had exhausted all means of looking for them in my small,
            boxed-in
            world. It was time to go. Where to? Didn’t matter. I just wanted to find someone who could help my little
            confused self.</p>
        <p>I took one last look around the room, and especially at my bed. This place, for good or for bad, had been my
            home
            for a long time, as well as the only place I could remember so far. Of course I was going to miss it.
            However, I
            didn’t belong there - not that I knew exactly where I did belong, either, but I had the impression a lonely
            hospital room wasn’t exactly it. I turned around and never looked back. The door’s tiny window offered me no
            useful hints about what I would find out there, so I slowly turned the knob and opened the door.</p>
        <p>As if the humming of the lights wasn’t irritating enough inside the room, it was several times worse in the
            corridor I found myself in. And despite all the lights, it still felt dimly lit. I peeked outside the door,
            and
            was faced with several doors, one after the other, in both directions and both sides of the hallway, all
            marked
            with numbers above them. Mine was numbered 427. Oddly, that number, uniquely associated with me, was now the
            closest thing I had to a name.</p>
        <p>The polished floor vaguely reflected lamps which, unlike the ones in my room, were hidden by diffuse panels,
            looking like glowing squares and confounding themselves among the ceiling tiles. There was little
            colour--everything was in some shade of grey or white. Every step of mine, especially those taken with my
            metallic leg, echoed deep into both directions. Both were equally uninviting, but I could see some kind of
            light
            coming from the end to my right. In this case, following the light felt like the wiser choice.</p>
        <p>The room across mine was numbered 426. I couldn’t help but take a look at its window, mentally apologizing to
            the
            fellow patient whose privacy I was disturbing. As it turned out, such apologies were unnecessary, because
            said
            patient didn’t exist: the room was vacant. As was room 425, and room 424, and... I’ll save you the reading:
            every room from 401 to 426 was empty. As was every room from 428 to 450--I had doubled back to the left upon
            deciding, more out of desperation than anything, to check all doors. No luck. As I finished my inspection of
            room 401, I noticed there was a nurses’ station on that end of that corridor. It wasn’t just empty; it
            looked
            pristine, untouched. That disturbed me deeply.</p>
        <p>I was now near the source of the aforementioned light: a double door with frosted glass windows, their
            patterns
            consisting of intersecting diagonal lines. Above them was a sign that gave me hope: a white depiction of a
            person running towards a door against a green background, next to the word “EXIT”. I had one final look at
            the
            corridor and at the station, still in disbelief. If I really wasn’t dreaming--still a debatable matter--then
            what the hell was going on? Where was, you know, everyone? Anyone? I needed to find out. I opened the double
            door, with some effort.</p>
        <p>I was briefly blinded by the light. After that... I couldn’t believe my eyes.</p>
        <p><a href="#5" class="day" id="5"></a>The sound of the lights was gone--replaced by the chirping of birds
            echoing across the massive area I
            entered. I
            was in some kind of balcony that surrounded all four sides of a colossal, rectangular empty space that
            extended
            two floors above me and three below. On the bottom was a garden, completely overgrown. It was as if the
            plants
            entered some kind of symbiosis with the concrete they were growing on. Vivid sun rays penetrated the glass
            roof
            above it all. To say I had never seen something like this before is... unfair, as my lack of memory made
            that
            more than a mere hyperbole. But it was a remarkable place, especially in contrast to my humble room.</p>
        <p>There were several doors on the balconies, too, but they were not marked with numbers, and the rooms behind
            them
            were unlike the ones I had seen. Some of them were “Observation” rooms with several beds, simpler than the
            ones
            I had seen and the one I had lived in. Others were dedicated to harboring heavier medical equipment,
            especially
            for testing and treatment. As I walked along the concrete ledge, occasionally passing behind pillars, I
            noticed
            each floor seemed to be a carbon copy of the one below. That meant every floor had all of these rooms... and
            therefore, all of those rooms, too.</p>
        <p>On the side opposite to the one I came from was a series of stairs and lifts connecting a total of six
            floors. I
            ignored the lifts--I had also found one in the darker end of my room’s hallway, next to door 450--as I felt
            like
            I couldn’t stop walking anymore. Not after my long sleep. I needed to stretch my legs... leg. One of them
            couldn’t really be stretched. There was a large “4” marked next to the stairs, which made sense. The fourth
            floor, and also the explanation for the leading digit of every numbered door I had seen. I started going
            down,
            with no specific objective in mind. But I only reached the third floor before stopping. Something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>I once again gazed at the garden and the roof. The overgrowth was more apparent on the third floor, and it
            made
            me worried. I had initially, and naively, assumed it was an odd aesthetic choice by whoever designed the
            hospital. But each step of mine echoed for seconds on end; my steps, and only mine. This area seemed to be
            very
            central, and considering the importance of the rooms I was going past, it should have some activity. But of
            course, it didn’t. And there was one, and only one, obvious explanation. I didn’t want to accept it, though.
            Who
            would? Would you?</p>
        <p>I started wandering, somewhat aimlessly, around the corridor. I just wanted to find someone, anyone, but my
            optimism was inversely proportional to the distance I walked. Upon nearing a double door identical to the
            one I
            had opened, I stopped again. I had to make sure this wasn’t some kind of mistake. Maybe the obvious
            explanation
            was wrong. Maybe, by some sheer coincidence, I was the only patient on that floor. The hospital had seen
            better
            days, or was built with an overestimated capacity. At least that would explain none of the other rooms being
            used--they didn’t have to be.</p>
        <p>I wouldn’t need a Radiography--I thought as I looked back and saw that room--if I had been knocked out. Maybe
            the
            patients on the other floors didn’t either, or simply weren’t having any at that specific time. And there
            had to
            be at least one staff member around, who routinely refilled my IV and even watered the poor orchids, because
            why
            wouldn’t you? But I had to be sure. And so, I shouted, causing the birds nearby to fly away:</p>
        <p>“Hello? Is anybody there?”</p>
        <p><a href="#6" class="day" id="6"></a>I tried being as loud as I could, which wasn’t much in the condition I
            was in, but I didn’t have to. The
            words
            echoed across the whole lobby. And yet, my greatest fear was confirmed: there was no answer. I repeated
            myself
            at least two times. Still no answer. I felt the panic setting in, just like when I realised I couldn’t
            remember
            anything. And that panic added to this one, too, because it meant no one could tell me anything about
            myself.
            But... but it made no sense. I had not one, but two, aforementioned pieces of evidence that there was
            someone
            else. I recomposed myself. Maybe that person was in the corridor behind the double door, tending to the
            other
            patients, and didn’t listen to me. I ran as fast as I could in that direction, and arrived panting, more
            from
            anxiety than due to the actual running. I closed my eyes and opened the door.</p>
        <p>The hallway was exactly like the one I had emerged from. I almost thought I was hallucinating, but the first
            door
            was clearly numbered 301. And it was empty, as was the nurses’ station, again. 302, empty. 303. 304. 305...
            at
            some point, I stopped reacting. My expression was fixed: my sole visible eye was wide open and sweat poured
            from
            my face. Eventually, I reached room 327, the one directly below mine. I didn’t just look at it; I went into
            it.
            It looked exactly the same as my room, and any other room ending with an odd number. I threw myself on its
            bed
            and laid on my back, disoriented. The headache, which had never completely faded away, intensified again.
            The
            obvious explanation was inevitable now.</p>
        <p>They left me behind.</p>
        <p>The hospital wasn’t below capacity, it was abandoned. That’s why it was overgrown. And for some reason, they
            couldn’t, or didn’t want to, transfer me somewhere else. But they didn’t want to just end it all for me,
            either.
            I could imagine the conversation: “We can do nothing for the poor girl. But let’s leave her there--she’ll
            either
            unfortunately die or miraculously wake up. Let’s pay someone to show up there from time to time, keep an eye
            on
            her, and change her IV. And water her orchids.” It could be safely assumed that they weren’t really counting
            on
            a miracle.</p>
        <p>My thoughts went silent again. I had been thinking about just leaving, but... What was the point? If I was
            forgotten in a hospital bed, what would there be for me out there? I was a nobody. I didn't even have a
            name. At
            most, I was just a number: Patient 427. If you were to believe the monitor's flatline--which I could
            actually
            faintly hear coming from the room directly upstairs--Patient 427 had a cardiac arrest shortly after a sudden
            increase in her otherwise stable heartbeat rate. Rest in peace. Her body was mysteriously missing from her
            bed,
            though.</p>
        <p>Patient 427’s living body was still on the bed of room 327. The view was familiar, as was the humming of the
            lights. But besides that and the aforementioned muffled--and annoying--high-frequency tone, it was quiet.
            And
            this mattress was significantly more comfortable than my old, depressed one. I had no idea how long I had
            been
            conscious, but it was probably shorter than the time I spent in that position staring at nothing. At some
            point,
            I turned my head to the left. After a few seconds of processing what I was looking at, I was startled. Wait,
            what? There...</p>
        <p>There was someone sitting on the chair next to my bed!</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p><a href="#7" class="day" id="7"></a>I woke up illuminated by the strong, white lights above me.</p>
        <p>They say dreams are created from the things we have experienced recently. I hadn’t experienced a lot, so it
            makes
            sense that it’d take place in a room exactly like the one I was in. To be fair, the dream was the only
            reason I
            even realised I fell asleep. Needless to say, when I woke up, I was in total shock.</p>
        <p>Hyperventilating again, I frantically tried recomposing myself. I could feel the weight of my body again.
            Everything was still there: the eye patch, the curative on my arm, the gown, the necklace, my metallic leg,
            and,
            of course, the migraine. Even the pair of sandals was still on the floor. I opened the door and
            double-checked
            the number of the room across mine... 326. Okay, so everything up to that point had been real. Good to know.
        </p>
        <p>That person... from the dream... I couldn’t remember their face now, but it suddenly clicked. That chair in
            my
            room had stuck out to me earlier, and I finally realised why. It was facing my bed, wasn’t it? Somehow, I
            just
            knew. Someone had been sitting on it... someone important. And they were watching over me. I didn’t know
            who, or
            when, and I had probably never seen that with my own eyes, considering I was, well, indisposed, but...</p>
        <p>No. I was just seeing things. This room’s chair wasn’t even facing towards me. It was perfectly tucked under
            its
            desk.</p>
        <p>This episode made me reconsider my reluctance to leave. Staying in that place most definitively meant going
            crazy. I knew the entire world didn’t boil down to that one abandoned hospital. Even if I couldn’t find
            anyone,
            which had unintentionally become my goal, that didn’t mean I couldn’t find an exit. And I knew there were
            lots
            of people out there, even if I couldn’t remember any. Someone would help me, in one way or another. Even if
            I
            was just Patient 427. I could get a new name... or, preferably, remember my real one.</p>
        <p>If there was an exit, it would have to be on the first floor. I didn’t want to waste any more time, my
            earlier
            resolution to walk as much as possible notwithstanding, so I took to the left and onwards to the lift. Yes,
            every room from 328 to 350 was empty too. Calling it took mere seconds as it was already parked on the
            second
            floor. The doors opened and I was surprised to see... myself! The mirror inside was way bigger than the one
            in
            the bathroom. The ride two floors down was short, but I spent every second curiously staring at my own
            image. So
            that was me, huh?</p>
        <p>As the doors opened again, I saw myself in yet another dimly lit corridor, exactly like the previous two.
            Checking doors was already becoming kind of a ritual for me, albeit an unproductive one, as rooms 150 to 101
            were all vacant. Room 101 was doubly vacant: it had no people and no furniture. I had a slightly eerie
            feeling
            when looking through its window, but couldn’t bring myself to actually go in. Something told me I probably
            shouldn’t. They emptied it for a reason. I opened the double doors, now face to face with the lobby’s
            exquisite
            nature.</p>
        <p>I quickly noticed this floor was different from the five above it. There were the usual medical rooms along
            the
            corridors surrounding the garden, but in the center of each longer side of the rectangle, where there should
            be
            a space with waiting chairs, laid two more sets of double doors. I noticed this when walking along the left
            side
            of the lobby from my entrance’s perspective, so that is where I headed. The sign above the doors read
            “Kitchen”.
        </p>
        <p>As with most rooms in that place, I could grasp what the concept of a kitchen was, but I couldn’t remember
            any
            specific examples. Even then... I was fairly sure that the room I entered did not look like what I was
            expecting. Upon opening the doors, which had more unhelpful windows--round, for a change--I couldn’t pay
            attention to anything but the... conveyor belt in the middle of it.</p>
        <p><a href="#8" class="day" id="8"></a>I walked towards it, intent on inspecting it. A closer look revealed what
            exactly it was doing there: it
            brought
            in all kinds of ingredients. More fascinating was the fact that they looked fresh, which shouldn’t be the
            case
            in a place like that. The belt extended from one end of the room to another and had several tables complete
            with
            ovens and sinks next to it. That was where the actual cooking was done, I assumed. That meant the
            ingredients
            were probably renewed regularly, and apparently without anyone lifting a finger. But that wasn’t the most
            interesting part. That would be... me.</p>
        <p>The kitchen reminded me that food was a thing that existed. It hadn’t crossed my mind until then, but there
            was a
            pretty fundamental question: how didn’t I starve while in my... long nap? I was only wearing the oxygen mask
            when I woke up, and nothing else. No weird tube or anything that could do that. Another item added to the
            “things that make no sense” list. It was already getting pretty long. Yet another item: I wasn’t hungry. At
            all.
            Even after walking the distance that I did, and undergoing several energy-consuming emotional outbursts. I
            was
            dying of thirst--a drinking fountain next to some lunch tables solved that--but definitely wasn’t hungry.
        </p>
        <p>In fact... I was the opposite of hungry. I had only been able to get so close to the conveyor belt until I
            was
            suddenly paralysed. The food... distressed me, somehow. Something very strong in me prevented me from
            approaching it any further. Was it fear...? But why would I fear food? I couldn’t tell what it was. But I
            couldn’t fight it, either--for some reason, I felt like I had no choice but to comply. The mere sight of the
            ingredients was discomforting, let alone the smell--good or bad, it didn’t matter. I couldn’t stay there. I
            turned around, wondering what the hell was wrong with me. And a little nauseated, again. The migraine didn’t
            help.</p>
        <p>I pretty much threw myself onto one of the lunch table chairs. Seriously, what was wrong with me? Was this a
            side
            effect of whatever had happened? Or was it just because I had vomited earlier? Those seemed like reasonable
            conclusions, but at the same time... the idea of not having that feeling... didn’t compute. I had no
            memories,
            but that felt like it was part of me. I was just like that, and nothing could ever change it. But then...
            How
            did I function as a member of society? And worse, what did that mean for my future, in case nobody who knew
            me
            before could help me? Would I have to go through additional suffering just to survive...?</p>
        <p>My pondering was rudely interrupted by a constant, low-frequency noise coming from the lobby. It was
            discrete,
            but loud enough to alarm me.</p>
        <p>I opened the door and took a look around. I couldn’t see anything, but I could tell where exactly the sound
            was
            coming from: above. I stayed in that position--my head popping out from the kitchen, if one was to look from
            the
            corridor--for well over a minute. It didn’t stop. It wasn’t threatening by itself, but I didn’t like it...
            mostly because I had no way of knowing what it could be. Some kind of machine, probably, but it had started
            out
            of nowhere. Did something make it start? I hadn’t touched anything. Or was it someone else? I hoped it was
            someone else.</p>
        <p>That very small hope is what prompted me to go investigate it, but not before taking a frying pan from the
            top of
            one of the ovens. Just in case. Part of me wanted to take a knife from the counter instead, but a pan not
            only
            had a... broader set of uses, but it also didn’t make me look like a threat if there really was someone up
            there. You’d be terrified if you saw a woman in a gown and wearing an eye patch coming at you with a knife,
            wouldn’t you?</p>
        <p>I slowly walked out of the kitchen, along the corridor and towards the stairs, the number “1” painted next to
            them. More exercise for my fragile legs... leg, I figured, and maybe it wasn’t a good idea to announce my
            arrival with the lift going up. As I crept along the hallway, I thought something was... off, but I couldn’t
            tell what. As if something about the whole scene I was witnessing... didn’t fit. Out of place.</p>
        <p>Arriving at the second floor made the origin of the sound clearer: that very level. The only one of the
            bottom
            four I hadn’t been to. Of course there would be something important there, just because I had skipped it.
            The
            noise came from the side opposite to me; thus, near the double doors leading to rooms 201 to 250. That place
            was
            becoming too predictable. Oddly, even as I got closer, I still couldn’t see anything.</p>
        <p>But the sound kept getting louder, and... I don’t know how to explain it, but it was as if I had always been
            hearing it. I walked the entire length of the balcony on the left side, looking from the stairs where I came
            from. When I reached the end, I looked to the right... and immediately let out a scream:</p>
        <p>“AAAH!”</p>
        <p>I lifted up the pan, ready to strike the source of my scare.</p>
        <p><a href="#9" class="day" id="9"></a>But, believe it or not... it talked.</p>
        <p>“Wait, wait, wait! Don’t hurt me, ma’am! I haven’t done anything!”</p>
        <p>“W-what? You talk? Who... what the hell are you?!” I asked, instinctively thinking it could hear me. Either
            way, I was still in my fighting stance, just in case it made any sudden moves I didn’t like.</p>
        <p>The object in question was a... vacuum cleaner. At least that’s what it looked like at first glance. When it
            turned to me, I saw it was more than that: a fully functional robot. It was shaped like a trapezoidal prism,
            its angled side facing toward me with a black screen that displayed a startled animated face. Cute.</p>
        <p>The main body rode on two sets of caterpillar wheels, and it had two arms: the right one was mechanical and
            full of joints and the left one was, in fact, a vacuum cleaner tube. I seemed to have interrupted its job.
            That was what felt off earlier: all of the corridors were clean, despite the abandonment of the facility and
            the overgrowth of the garden. It was contradictory, but this weird machine seemed to be the explanation.</p>
        <p>“I am the Basic Maintenance & Cleaning unit, BMC for short, serial number 56, ma’am!” Its emoticon changed to
            a happy one. It was mesmerizing. “Um... c-can you put that stainless steel frying pan down, please? I am not
            a threat... I-I hope you agree, at least.” The expression became worried.</p>
        <p>The robot’s voice was... robotic, of course, but it had a male undertone, so the thing was a “he” to me.
            Either way, I obliged, with my face slightly red at the fact I almost attacked a vacuum cleaner half of my
            height with a pan. I wondered if that would hurt. Probably not.</p>
        <p>“Oh, um, sorry for that...” I apologized, confused. Make no mistake: I was terrified at that sudden
            encounter. My face was sweating, again. “I-I heard your noise, and... didn’t know what I would find up
            here.”</p>
        <p>“No problem, ma’am!” Happy expression again. He then stopped for a moment and wheeled closer to me. I assumed
            his “eyes” were on the screen. He was scanning me, probably. “I recognize your face. You are... Patient 427,
            correct?”</p>
        <p>That trick surprised me.</p>
        <p>“Y-yes, I think I am... I woke up in that room... on that bed. I... don’t remember anything, sorry. Do you...
            know anything about me?” I was slightly hopeful.</p>
        <p>“Well, ma’am, I unfortunately don’t have access to the files of patients or hospital staff, so I can’t tell
            you much beyond the data on you I have in my memory.”</p>
        <p>“Oh...” I sighed in disappointment. How foolish of me to expect anything positive. “But what would that
            entail, then?”</p>
        <p>“Based on your latest regular blood test by me, your blood type is A- and you can be estimated to be around
            21 years old. Physically, you are about 169 centimeters tall and weigh between 50 and 60 kilo-”</p>
        <p>“Alright, that’s going to be enough, thank you,” I interrupted. How rude of him to try measuring that. But
            the age estimate was interesting. I thought it made sense. At least it meant I’d have a lot of time to try
            and remember things before kicking the bucket. Hopefully. He continued:</p>
        <p>“You were in a comatose state for as long as I have been operating here, ma’am, which would be... 1241 days,
            or over three years. You were probably in that state for longer, however, as you were already like that when
            I arrived.”</p>
        <p>That information was hard to digest. At least three years sleeping. If I really was 21, that meant I had
            spent around one seventh of my life on that damn bed. I tried avoiding discussing the subject of time
            further, and instead asked one of my biggest questions:</p>
        <p>“Any ideas on how I didn’t... you know, die?” Given my situation when I woke up, all things considered, it
            seemed to me that even being alive was a miracle in itself.</p>
        <p>“Modesty aside, ma’am, I have been tending to you regularly for all these years. I made sure to keep your
            condition stable by constantly running tests and regulating your IV. I am, of course, not a medical
            professional of any kind, but in the absence of one...”</p>
        <p>Wait. So he was the one who did all of those things? Really? A robot?</p>
        <p>“And... you... you were watering the orchids in my room too...?”</p>
        <p>”Correct, ma’am! And I hope you liked the playlist selection on the radio. Er, when you became able to listen
            to it, of course.”</p>
        <p>I would have, if the “playlist” didn’t consist of exactly one song on loop. Either way, I was somewhat
            disoriented. This confirmed my earlier fear of having been abandoned in a lonely hospital room. Sure, there
            was something taking care of me, but... ugh. I sat on one of the nearby chairs, resting my elbows on my
            knees, or equivalents thereof, and with my hands on my chin. I put the pan on the chair next to me. Could I
            really trust that... thing?</p>
        <p>“Well then... uh... Vac. Can I call you Vac?” Don't ask me what made me think of that name, but it was, quite
            frankly, brilliant. And far easier to pronounce than “bee-em-see” or even “fifty-six”.</p>
        <p>“Of course, ma’am! All autonomous units are designed to respond to human-assigned nicknames for greater
            comfort and convenience.”</p>
        <p>“All autonomous units”. That he wasn’t the only one was obvious; he was just the only one around. I figured
            that the world must be full of those. Who wouldn’t want that? Robots that do cleaning for you, conveyor
            belts that bring ingredients to you...</p>
        <p>Right. What I was going to ask.</p>
        <p>“Do you know if there was anyone in my room watching over me...? There was this chair, and-”</p>
        <p>“Probably, ma’am, but that would have to have been before I was assigned to this wing. The truth is, you are
            the first and only human I have encountered in my current memory session.”</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>What?!</p>
        <p><a href="#10" class="day" id="10"></a>“Hold on, hold on. You’re telling me you don’t have any idea of where
            everyone went, either?” I asked, a bit
            shocked, as I quickly got up from the chair. I felt an uneasy chill over me. I didn’t like any of that.</p>
        <p>“That’s right, ma’am. I was sent here as a replacement for a prior unit that was damaged in the ‘chaos of the
            previous day’, whatever that meant. It probably had to do with the mess that was this place when I arrived.
            Of course, my first task was to clean that up.”</p>
        <p>“But... How do you not know anything? How have you not met anyone? Don’t you work for... people?”</p>
        <p>“Negative. I’m merely a child program following instructions from the mainframe. For safety reasons, I do not
            have access to certain databases and my memory is wiped with every new assignment to improve performance.”
        </p>
        <p>That flicked a switch inside me. I thought he was just withholding information, but in reality, he was on the
            same boat as me. He knew how to go about, but had no idea about what had happened. I did ask, though, just
            to make sure:</p>
        <p>“Why haven’t you tried finding out, then?”</p>
        <p>The expression on the screen changed to a confused one. Still a wonder to look at.</p>
        <p>“Excuse me, ma’am...? What do you mean?”</p>
        <p>“Aren’t you... your own self? How have you just accepted this and lived with this for three years? I’ve been
            awake for what, three hours, and I already...”</p>
        <p>My philosophical question was directed at the robot, but I think it hit the wall and bounced right back at
            me. As I slowly realised what I was saying, I put my back against the concrete pillar behind me and slid
            down, ending up sitting in a fetal position. I finished my line of thought, my voice cracking:</p>
        <p>“I already... can’t accept any of it...”</p>
        <p>Audible sniff. I buried my face in my hands. I don’t know what exactly caused that. I guess I just needed to
            let it all out. And I couldn’t sleep it away this time. When I did, I genuinely thought I was crazy and none
            of that could be real. But now I knew it was.</p>
        <p>My reflex made me look up when I felt something touching my head. Despite everything being blurry--this time
            from the tears--I could see a robotic arm gently caressing my hair. It was... unexpected, but comforting.
        </p>
        <p>“T-thanks,” I said, sobbing. “I... needed that.”</p>
        <p>I really did, even if it came from a vacuum cleaner. Apparently, I wasn’t allowed the luxury of human
            contact.</p>
        <p>“To answer your question, ma’am,” the robot said as it helped me get up, “I am not really my own ‘self’. I am
            not what you would call ‘sentient’. I just follow my programming and the orders from the mainframe. There
            isn’t much for me to question. In fact, there isn’t much for me to do at all other than my tasks... that is,
            in the absence of a human.”</p>
        <p>I wiped my eye--the other didn’t need wiping--and got curious. In the absence of a human? I didn’t ask that,
            though. I didn’t need to. It was as if he read my mind:</p>
        <p>“Human commands override my regular programming, ma’am. Or, as you just saw, any human needs, even emotional.
            Paradoxical, considering I myself don’t really have emotions.”</p>
        <p>And yet... technically, it would be unfair for me to say this, since I had no way to know what other humans
            were like, but I was under the strong impression he was more compassionate than any of them. Hell, I almost
            hit him on sight earlier. Now I felt really bad about that one.</p>
        <p>Alright, focus. It was just another breakdown, nothing more. I was starting to get used to them. So I had
            really been the only patient here after... something happened. My little new friend didn't know what that
            was, so we skip that part. What he did know for a fact was the condition I had been in. He was there the
            whole time, after all. So, after recomposing myself, I decided to continue our little interview.</p>
        <p><a href="#11" class="day" id="11"></a>“So, Vac, any idea about how I got this?” I said, placing my metallic
            leg over the ledge. It was a good way
            to show it to him, but it sounded way better in my head. I hadn’t thought about how to put it back down. It
            was... not an enjoyable experience.</p>
        <p>“From the state you were in on your bed, ma’am, it’s clear that you suffered a major accident, likely a
            vehicle collision, involving fire. You sustained injuries that cost you your left leg as well as blunt force
            trauma on your head, which is why you had those bandages and probably why you don’t seem to remember
            anything.”</p>
        <p>Ouch. Vehicle collision. Not remembering that part was actually a good thing. I continued:</p>
        <p>“...And they replaced it with this one. Got it. But... if I was there for over three years, how didn’t I...
            die from hunger? It’s not like I could...” I sighed. “Or would want to... eat anything.”</p>
        <p>“That would be thanks to me, ma’am. I periodically brought in a feeding tube to, well, feed you. Your IV
            contained hormones that slowed your metabolism down, so I didn’t have to do that extraordinarily often.”</p>
        <p>“And the last time was...?”</p>
        <p>“Today! A few hours before you woke up, to be more precise.”</p>
        <p>I couldn’t believe my luck. If I had woken up only a bit sooner, I would have been forced to deal with
            removing that thing. I really, really didn’t want to imagine that. Actually... I didn’t ask, for obvious
            reasons, but I came to the conclusion he would also have to deal with all of my... physiological needs...
            from time to time. Ew. I did not envy his job. My last question:</p>
        <p>“That oxygen mask... was it really necessary?”</p>
        <p>“Not at all, ma’am. I kept it there because, you know, it was already there when I arrived. Again, I’m not a
            medical professional, so I didn’t want to risk killing the only human I had to take care of. At the very
            least, the mainframe would fry my circuits.”</p>
        <p>“Great, because taking that blasted thing off gave me the headache of a lifetime.” It still hurt, by the way.
            I wouldn’t be walking near ledges with half of my field of view blocked for no reason. Although, as with
            most things, I was growing used to it.</p>
        <p>“Really, ma’am? I was wondering why you had that eye patch, since you didn’t have it when you were asleep.
            Give me a minute, please.”</p>
        <p>He then turned around and wheeled away. I observed him as he went into a distant room, with the sign
            “Pharmacy” next to it, fascinated by the way he used his arm to turn the knob, which was above his height.
            Some moments later, he returned carrying something red.</p>
        <p>“Here, ma’am,” he said as he dropped it on my palm, “this should take care of your headache.”</p>
        <p>Now that was something I wasn’t expecting: medicated by a vacuum cleaner. Somehow, that was too much. I
            needed to be left alone for a second.</p>
        <p>“Oh...! Thank you, Vac. I’ll... go to the kitchen and get a cup of water to take it, okay?”</p>
        <p>“No problem, ma’am! I’ll be up here.”</p>
        <p>That was only partially an excuse. I wasn’t actually going to take the pill dry. Amnesia and being civilised
            aren’t mutually exclusive.</p>
        <p>As I walked away, I heard the vacuum cleaner turn on again, the sound growing more muffled with the distance.
            If it had been a source of fear earlier, it was now comforting--a reminder that I wasn’t alone after all.
            Just not in the way I had been expecting. In fact, as I went down the stairs again, I realized that I now
            felt even lonelier than before. It was uncomfortable to be alone, after meeting him. I guess that’s what
            happens if you find yourself in my situation--you grow attached to a robot. But not without merit. He had
            pretty much saved my life.</p>
        <p>The echoing sound from above served as a reminder, together with the knowledge of why those hallways were so
            clean, of that poor thing’s routine. That’s all he did. Day after, and day after, and day after, and he
            didn’t know why. It was just his programming; the “orders from the mainframe”. Come to think of it, taking
            care of me was his only minimally different activity. Probably gross at times, yes, but according to him,
            driven by his directive to help humans instead of simple orders. It was the closest thing to free will he
            had.</p>
        <p>And what would it be like for him--I thought, as I swallowed the red pill--now that I was awake? In a way, I
            felt guilty. Obviously, waking up wasn’t my fault, but it didn’t change that fact. Somehow, the idea of him
            remaining in this place and doing his repetitive, monotonous tasks, for as long as his joints didn’t rust,
            was a bit heart-wrenching. It didn’t even have a purpose. Nobody was using this place anymore. But one
            thing, and one thing only, could change that: me. I had wanted to leave since my latest dream, yes, but I
            also wanted to take him with me now. It’s not like I wanted to be alone again, either. Everyone would win-
        </p>
        <p>“WHAT THE-” I blurted out as I felt something tapping my shoulder.</p>
        <p><a href="#12" class="day" id="12"></a>“Hello again, ma’am!” Vac waved his robotic arm as I turned back with
            my face whiter than the bandages around my head.</p>
        <p>The expression on his screen was a smirk. What a jerk. A lucky jerk, if you will: I had just put the
            “stainless steel frying pan” back onto the oven. Had he pulled this stunt mere minutes before, he would have
            become metal scrap. He wouldn’t even have time to feel a thing, if he... felt it at all. I lashed out at
            him:</p>
        <p>“Vac... can you please not scare the life out of me minutes after telling me you would be somewhere else?
            That would be really nice of you.” I tried somewhat ridiculously hard to force an angry
            expression. I think it worked, since his display changed to a sad face as he replied:</p>
        <p>“Okay, ma’am, sorry for that...” It then changed to a neutral face again. “But I was, in fact, going to be up
            there, as I told you. However, I decided to take the elevator down and check on you after I noticed you were
            having some difficulty going down the stairs.”</p>
        <p>Damn it. Another spontaneous act of kindness making me ashamed of my intrusive thoughts about mistreating
            robots. I lowered my tone:</p>
        <p>“Oh... sorry for yelling at you, then. Just, seriously, don’t do that again. This place is creepy enough on
            its own, for more reasons than one.” I said that as I looked at the conveyor belt in the middle of the
            kitchen.</p>
        <p>“‘Patient 427 does not like being scared’. Noted, ma’am.”</p>
        <p>“As for my walking... don’t worry about me, Vac. It’s just... this thing feels weird. I can move it, but I
            can’t... feel it. It’s way too weird to go around like this, especially with my other leg being... mostly...
            fine.”</p>
        <p>“Hey, it’s alright. I can move my entire body and can’t feel a thing either. You’ll get used to it.”</p>
        <p>He had a point. At least only my leg was robotic. Could be way worse - imagine having an arm like that. Not
            being able to feel your hand and fingers... ugh. I simply nodded in agreement and fell silent, leaning back
            against the wall next to the door leading to the corridor. But before I could think about anything,
            something unexpected happened:</p>
        <p>“Ma’am, can I ask you a question?” Vac suddenly said.</p>
        <p>“Huh?” I was surprised. “Uh, sure...?”</p>
        <p>“What happened to your hair? It wasn’t like that when you were in a coma.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I cut it. I felt like it wasn’t supposed to be that long. It’s better this way. It makes me feel...
            lighter, somehow. I guess literally, too.”</p>
        <p>Interesting. So he was paying attention to me visually as well. How far could I push that? I looked down
            directly at his screen and tested it:</p>
        <p>“How do I look, by the way?”</p>
        <p>“I am not designed to provide subjective opinions on the appearance of humans, ma’am. Deep down, I’m just an
            AI language model-”</p>
        <p>“Mhm. But what’s your main takeaway from looking at my expression? I mean, if you could estimate my height...
            and weight... surely you can deduce more things about me?”</p>
        <p>“You look tired, ma’am. Without a shadow of a doubt.”</p>
        <p>That was surgical. And that was after I had thoroughly washed my face earlier. Had he seen it before, he
            might as well have sent me to the morgue. I guess he hadn’t completely discarded that, though:</p>
        <p>“Upon closer analysis with better lighting, you’re also looking a bit... pale. Likely due to the fact you had
            no sunlight exposure for the last few years...” Likely...? Generous, that one. “...And possibly contributing
            to that is the fact your ‘diet’ hasn’t been exactly ideal, ma’am. Have you not felt hungry since waking up?”
        </p>
        <p>“No, not at all.” I was slightly annoyed at him bringing that up. I didn’t want to think about it. Nobody
            wants to think about things that are clearly wrong with them. “Anything else?”</p>
        <p>“That necklace... I remember it clearly, ma’am. It was on the table, wasn’t it?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah. I think it was mine. And if it wasn’t, it is now. It’s not like anyone is around to complain about
            it.”</p>
        <p>“Well, I surely won’t. I can’t wear it, unless you hang it around one of my arms. But it is very beautiful,
            and I believe it’s not the only one of its kind.”</p>
        <p>“Wait, what?” That caught me off guard. “Go on.”</p>
        <p>“If you look closely, you can see the inner half of the crescent moon has a unique outline. It seems to me
            that a sun necklace would perfectly match that, if put together.”</p>
        <p>That... that made... a lot of sense. Something told me that was it. It wasn’t quite a memory--I wish it
            was--, but it was a strong feeling. Someone I knew wore that. Someone I...</p>
        <p>Someone I... loved?</p>
        <p>A storm started in my head. The chair, the necklace... that’s why they felt familiar. There was one, and only
            one, feeling that could be strong enough to persist even after I apparently hit my head really hard and
            forgot everything else.</p>
        <p>But, in that case... where was that person? How was I supposed to even begin finding out? It seemed like a
            lost cause. I doubted they had taken part in abandoning me, so chances were they were just... gone, somehow.
            After pondering for a while, playing with the necklace in my hand, I simply said, with some sadness:</p>
        <p>“I... I guess you could be right, but I don’t think that’s a mystery we’ll solve.”</p>
        <p><a href="#13" class="day" id="13"></a>The conversation trailed off. The migraine persisted, and it would
            probably be a while until the painkiller
            took effect. And considering the sheer amount of pain, I seriously considered the possibility of asking for
            another dose later. But for now, what I really needed was just to take a breather. Too much had happened and
            too long a distance had been walked--not to mention stairs climbed--so I continued leaning against the wall
            with my arms crossed. I was still staring at the only even remotely interesting thing in that room, Vac,
            with a slight, smug smile, which I was largely forcing to hide the chaos in my mind. He was staring back,
            more or less, although he randomly moved and looked around the room.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I broke the ice:</p>
        <p>“So... technically, I am discharged from the hospital, right?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t have the expertise to diagnose you, ma’am, but I suppose that if you’re feeling well enough to be
            wandering around, sometimes armed with dangerous objects... although it would be prudent to perform proper
            exams on you.”</p>
        <p>Fat chance. I never wanted to see another needle again after the IV ordeal. My arm was also still hurting
            from that.</p>
        <p>“I’ll pass, thank you very much. In any case... what if I were to, you know... leave?”</p>
        <p>“Leave? You can leave at any time, ma’am. The exit is just across the garden from this kitchen.”</p>
        <p>Hold on. The other set of double doors... I hadn’t checked them at all. I pretty much instantly went running
            towards it, shouting as I went:</p>
        <p>“You coming or what?!”</p>
        <p>“Ma’am, I’m still not done with my cleanup on the sec-”</p>
        <p>“Screw that! Command override! Follow me!”</p>
        <p>“Fine, ma’am, wait for me!” I could hear his wheels setting off.</p>
        <p>The garden was too overgrown to directly cross, so I went by the corridors again. I could now notice that the
            sunrays from above were different: they were distinctly more red. As I passed the door to the patient rooms,
            I had an interesting thought: if I had taken the right instead of the left when I arrived at the ground
            floor, I’d already be out in the open world again, probably. But then I would never have met Vac. The extra
            time spent there had been worth it. The idea of continuing alone sounded... depressing, now.</p>
        <p>Especially because of what happened after.</p>
        <p>I reached the doors--panting, of course--and waited for Vac to arrive, disappointedly staring at the “EXIT”
            sign above the doors, wondering how I had missed that. When I looked at him, I noticed his wheels had left
            track marks on the floor. Good thing he wouldn’t have to clean that anymore--he just didn’t know it. I
            didn’t want to tell him he was coming with me yet.</p>
        <p>Yes, he was just an algorithm, but I still didn’t feel like... shocking him like that, considering tending to
            the hospital had been his entire purpose so far, mostly. My idea was just to make him stick to me for as
            long as possible and see what would happen. I supposed that at some point he’d ask where we were going. I
            didn’t intend to answer him. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I had no idea, either.</p>
        <p>At any rate, I opened the doors. We were faced with a hallway similar to the ones with the bedrooms, but it
            felt even more dimly lit. Most lighting, in fact, came from the “EXIT” sign at the end of it--it glowed red,
            instead of the usual green. And there were no doors on either side. It was an ominous sight. Figuring
            nothing could really go wrong, I said:</p>
        <p>“Well, ladies first.” I felt it was an appropriate idiom, somehow, despite being fairly sure it wasn’t used
            in contexts like crossing a dark corridor. I started slowly walking forward, and Vac wheeled behind me. A
            bit loudly, too. In spite of the eeriness of the scene, however, I can assure you it wasn’t the most
            terrifying part.</p>
        <p>The most terrifying part was when I realized the door was made of steel, pressed the button to open it, and
            was answered by an actual robotic voice coming from the panel’s speakers:</p>
        <p>“ACCESS DENIED. SECTOR UNDER LOCKDOWN FOR... 1... 2... 4... 1... DAYS DUE TO... LEVEL... 4... BIOHAZARD
            THREAT.”</p>
        <p>My world stopped after the word “lockdown”. As the voice continued, my face slowly changed to the most
            shocked expression you can possibly imagine. When the announcement ended, I don’t think any of my moments
            since waking up so far had been so silent. Vac was quiet; his screen also had a surprised expression. We
            looked at each other. Another idiom came to me. Even as an amnesiac, I was certain it was the only one that
            could possibly convey my feelings:</p>
        <p>“What the FUCK?!”</p>
        <p><a href="#14" class="day" id="14"></a>Everything was spinning. Almost as a reflex, I shook my head, took a
            deep breath, and pressed the button
            again. Surely that had only been an error. It was the first time in forever that someone had pressed it. It
            was broken. I wasn’t stuck there. I couldn’t be. It simply wasn’t possible. It wasn’t conceivable that I had
            suffered an accident, lost a leg, fallen into a coma for years, woken up to find myself alone and unable to
            remember anything, and was trapped there-</p>
        <p>“ACCESS DENIED. SECTOR UNDER LOCKDOWN FOR--”</p>
        <p>I screamed and punched the door. It hurt a lot, but I closed my eyes and did it again. And again. I only
            stopped when I heard a weak “ma’am” coming from behind. I snorted, frustrated, and turned around, my eyes
            wide open again--to the maximum extent they could be. I was shaking. Vac was too--his wheels were dancing
            randomly on the floor--but I had the impression that was more because he was scared of me.</p>
        <p>“M-ma’am,” he said again, “please... don’t hurt yourself like this...”</p>
        <p>I looked at my hand. It was red, and commenting on the pain is unnecessary, but I could barely feel it
            through the adrenaline. None of that felt real. I continued staring down at Vac as I tried to process what I
            had just heard. Futile. There was nothing to process--the message had already come across. A lot of words
            had been said by the speaker, and not all of them made sense to me, but that didn’t matter. The way I
            interpreted them was crystal clear:</p>
        <p>“You will never know who you are. You are just a number, Patient 427.”</p>
        <p>“You will never see another person again. You better hope that robot outlives you.”</p>
        <p>“Those orchids aren’t yours--they are for your grave.”</p>
        <p>As these thoughts echoed in my head, a smile spontaneously came across my face. And then my nose started
            blowing air out. It wasn’t long until the cycle became self-sustaining. When I woke up, I found something as
            innocent as my mattress being marked by my extended permanence on it funny. But this...? This was the
            pinnacle of comedy: the story of the most unfortunate woman who had ever lived. I couldn’t stop laughing.
        </p>
        <p>“Ma’am...!” Vac said after a solid minute of my crisis, probably panicking at the sight. “C-calm down... I
            know this is hard for you, but you clearly aren’t-”</p>
        <p>“Aren’t okay? Yeah, I’m not!" I interrupted him as I laughed. “Of course I’m not okay! Don’t you understand?
            I’m... hah... I’m... hahaha... I’m going to DIE IN HERE! ALONE! WITH A REALLY NICE TALKING VACUUM CLEANER!
            ISN’T IT HILARIOUS?!”</p>
        <p>“N-not really, no...” He replied, his expression worried. “Listen... you should sit down and...”</p>
        <p>At this point, everything becomes hazy. Dreamy. I can’t really tell what happened. I probably started
            ignoring him and wandering off. Where to is unclear. Even more unclear is what I wanted to achieve. I do
            have flashes of opening the door back into the lobby, and seeing the “1” painted on the wall by the stairs,
            going up on them, and the elevator doors opening--but not much beyond that. One feeling, however, I can
            distinctly remember:</p>
        <p>The electrical shock of 1200 volts from behind, causing me to pass out.</p>
        <p>I woke up illuminated by the strong, white lights above me.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p><a href="#15" class="day" id="15"></a>The room was different from what I was used to. It was bigger, and
            there were several beds next to mine. I had seen it before from the outside. “Observation”, wasn’t it? It
            definitively smelled different. Something in me knew that was the smell of cleaning products. Wait...
            cleaning?</p>
        <p>“Hey, you, finally awake!” I heard a familiar voice, but couldn’t exactly see the source from my position.
        </p>
        <p>“Vac...?” My voice was weak. I felt weak. But if it was any consolation, the headache was weaker too.
            “Weaker” meant it only hurt a lot, as opposed to being unbearable. Baby steps. But the eye patch still had
            to stay.</p>
        <p>“How are you feeling, ma’am?” Vac rhetorically asked me. “I’m... really sorry I had to do that, but I had no
            choice.”</p>
        <p>“Do... what? What did you do...?”</p>
        <p>“That shock that knocked you out... that was me, ma’am. Again, sorry for that-”</p>
        <p>“W-what? What was that for...?” I was genuinely clueless. I couldn’t remember what I was doing when that
            happened.</p>
        <p>“It was for your safety, ma’am. You were in a deeply unstable mental and emotional state. I couldn’t let
            you... harm yourself.”</p>
        <p>“Harm... myself...?”</p>
        <p>Harm myself? What was he-</p>
        <p>Oh, right, the stairs.</p>
        <p>Oh.</p>
        <p>“I see you remember. It’s best not to talk about it. You should be fine now.”</p>
        <p>“Fine”...? Nope. I don’t think anyone would be fine in my situation. Sure, I had recovered my senses and
            wasn’t having a psychotic laughter attack anymore, but I was still stuck there. I was still going to die in
            that place, even if not due to doing something stupid to myself. But, silver lining, I would have a lot of
            time to think of a way to escape, lockdown or otherwise. The problem was, I wanted to leave stat.</p>
        <p>I sighed again, resignedly. I could tell how grumpy my face looked as I laid there, still amazed at the
            combination of calamities that I found myself struck by. A perfect storm, no less. At the same time, some
            weight had arguably been removed from my shoulders; I had been pondering about how I would go about in the
            outside world, now that I at least had a "guide". All of that suddenly stopped mattering--it couldn't
            matter, as long as I was locked in that hospital.</p>
        <p>With all of that said, the weird thoughts you'd expect started forming in my head. Why even bother escaping
            at this point? Assuming it was possible at all, would it be worth the effort? It wasn't what I wanted,
            but... sometimes we don't get a choice, do we? I hadn't chosen to be in that situation at all. Probably. But
            I had to live with it, so why not spend my energy on making the best of it, instead of wasting it on chasing
            an uncertain objective? I would die in there eventually, but that didn’t mean I wouldn’t live long. As far
            as I could tell, I had everything I needed: shelter, water, and food, my issues with the latter
            notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>More importantly, Vac being around would be enough to prevent me from going insane. The simple fact I was on
            that bed after completely losing it minutes earlier was proof of that. Plus, he wouldn’t be condemned to his
            monotonous routine, either. I could find something to spend my time on. I could work on something, get good
            at something, and leave my tiny mark on this world, even if nobody would ever know. I likely had interests
            before whatever befell me, but those were gone, so I’d have to find new ones. The way Vac worked fascinated
            me. How could that little thing basically act like a living being? I wanted to find out everything behind
            it.</p>
        <p>And... who said that door would be closed forever? Who said no one would find and rescue us? Okay, I had been
            there for over three years, but what could happen within a span of, say, ten? Nothing was impossible, right?
            Nothing was impossible. I was getting ahead of myself with my utter defeatism. I hadn’t been awake--or, for
            all intents and purposes, alive--for even a single day. Calm down, Patient 427. You will be fine. Everything
            will be fine.</p>
        <p><a href="#16" class="day" id="16"></a>My annoyed expression had changed to a slight, hopeful smile. I turned
            on my side on my bed. Being finally able to do that was awesome. I could now see Vac on the other side of
            the room, using some kind of... device? on top of a table by the wall. I saw something weird for the first
            time: he could actually get taller if necessary--there was a hydraulic system between his wheels and his
            main body making his height... adjustable. I felt a little jealous, before quickly remembering I already had
            more than enough non-organic body parts.</p>
        <p>“Vac...?” I asked. “What are you up to?”</p>
        <p>“Me, ma’am?” he replied, briefly turning to me with a smiling emoji on his screen. I could see he was looking
            at a screen too--a monitor on top of the table. “I’m getting your blood exam results!”</p>
        <p>“Wha...?” I exclaimed, trailing off as I slowly turned to look at my left arm. There was another curative on
            it, way bigger and more well made than the previous. Noticing it almost felt like it activated the pain.
            Damn you, Vac. At least I didn’t have to see the actual thing, though.</p>
        <p>“There you go, ma’am,” he said as he lowered his body and wheeled across the room back towards me, “the
            results are here.”</p>
        <p>“Ugh. Go ahead. This better have been worth it.”</p>
        <p>“It says here you have mild anemia, ma’am, a trend that has been slowly increasing in your latest tests.
            That’s probably why you feel constantly tired.”</p>
        <p>Oddly, I knew what that word meant, apparently enough to try being witty about it:</p>
        <p>“And what should I do about it, Doctor Vac? Should I chew an iron bar?”</p>
        <p>“No, ma’am. Taking the iron supplements I left on the bedside table will be enough.” I realised he had, in
            fact, left them there. I found it oddly heartwarming. It was... considerate of him to try “fixing” me.</p>
        <p>“You should also take the vitamin supplements I gave you. A, B, C, E and K. D, well... you should too, but
            the lack of sunlight outside as of right now won’t help much.”</p>
        <p>Lack of sunlight, already? For how long had I been out? Come to think of it, it was probably around dusk that
            I had tried to leave, given the color of the dome’s sun rays.</p>
        <p>“Finally, your white cell levels are normal, as in every blood work of yours... except for the first ones,
            three years ago.”</p>
        <p>“Huh?” That attracted my curiosity a bit.</p>
        <p>“You had elevated levels of white cells at that time, yes, meaning you were probably fighting an infection.”
        </p>
        <p>Fighting an infection. “Biohazard threat”. You can’t be serious. They didn’t abandon me because of that,
            right...? That was ridiculous. If that was the case, why didn’t they just...</p>
        <p>I ended up thinking too loudly.</p>
        <p>“...Why didn’t they just put me down?” I mumbled. Vac heard that very clearly. My face turned red as his
            screen switched to a disapproving emoji:</p>
        <p>“Stop with those kinds of thoughts, ma’am, before I put you to sleep again.”</p>
        <p>I stared at him in silence and simply started pointing at every single thing that was wrong with me. He
            couldn’t deny it: me having survived was one hell of an anomaly.</p>
        <p>“Ma’am... you still want to leave, don’t you?” he said after a while and after the robotic equivalent of a
            sigh--the noise from within him becoming louder. His gears were turning, literally and figuratively. “I can
            see it in your face. You’re trying to convince yourself that staying is what you want, because you think
            it’s hopeless. You’re lying to yourself.”</p>
        <p>OUCH.</p>
        <p>“What, you don’t think it’s a lost cause...?” I pointed out: “Because that door isn’t going anywhere.”</p>
        <p>“The door isn’t going anywhere, indeed, but that doesn’t mean it can’t open. I haven’t ever tested this,
            but...”</p>
        <p>“But?!” I lifted my head up from the pillow. I could tell my eyes were glowing.</p>
        <p>“There is a chance that the lockdown can be overridden by one thing, and one thing only: a fire alarm.”</p>
        <p>A... fire... alarm?!</p>
        <p>I squinted my eyes while looking directly at where I imagined his camera was:</p>
        <p>“Say that again, please?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, ma’am, you heard that right. A fire alarm. Think about it: the lockdown was designed to keep people
            from moving in or out, but it couldn’t know on which side of that door they would end up. In fact, you
            should be thankful for that.”</p>
        <p>Right. In theory, people could be stuck inside or outside this wing of the hospital. It didn’t matter--I was
            living proof one could very well survive inside. The point was to separate people. The infected from the
            non-infected, it can be deduced. That still bothered me. Had I actually won that lottery too? Just me? It
            couldn’t be.</p>
        <p>“So, if there were people inside and a fire broke out, it wouldn’t be a good idea to have them stuck in
            there, no matter the circumstances,” Vac continued. His expression then changed to a smug one. “Of course,
            this was only implemented because nobody would be stupid enough to start a fire just to circumvent a
            lockdown.” He was staring directly into my soul as he said that.</p>
        <p>Hey, I hadn’t said anything yet!</p>
        <p><a href="#17" class="day" id="17"></a>“Stop looking at me! This is your idea,” I protested, slapping the top
            of his body.</p>
        <p>“Ouch, ma’am,” he complained. “But... we are out of options here. We will have to do exactly that: start a
            fire. Or rather-”</p>
        <p>“Can’t you just... hack the alarm or something?”</p>
        <p>“I wish I had that permission level in the network, ma’am. No can do.”</p>
        <p>“Amazing. So, any ideas? Do we just turn all the ovens in the kitchen on and see what happens?”</p>
        <p>“That would probably work, but we don’t want to start an actual fire that will kill... Well, you. I’d be
            fine, probably. We just need to trigger the alarm.”</p>
        <p>“Then, uh... there’s some alcohol around... wouldn’t that work?”</p>
        <p>“I said we need to trigger the alarm. We don’t actually need to set inflammable things on fire at all. We
            just need smoke.”</p>
        <p>“Smoke... without a fire? You’re not helping us here, Vac.”</p>
        <p>“There’s an elegant solution I was going to mention before you interrupted me with the hacking idea. There
            are some chemicals in the storage on the underground floor. Mixing them to cause a small explosion would be
            enough.”</p>
        <p>The... the... the WHAT floor?</p>
        <p>“Since when is there an underground floor?!” I asked, perplexed.</p>
        <p>“The button reading ‘0’ in the lobby’s elevators, ma’am...” Vac said, slightly disappointed.</p>
        <p>Unfair. Those were the elevators I deliberately did not take. The one I took didn’t have that.</p>
        <p>“So... I guess we get to work, then?” I said, struggling to get up from the bed. I was still dizzy from the
            shock. Bastard. And my arm still hurt. Bastard.</p>
        <p>“Right away, ma’am. It will be an honor to blow up things with you.”</p>
        <p>“Vac... I literally just woke up from a three-year coma and don’t remember anything, but even I know how
            weird that sounded,” I said, laughing, as I put my sandals on. “But indeed... It will be an honor, too.
            You’re a good friend. Thanks... for everything you’ve been doing for me.”</p>
        <p>Vac’s screen displayed, alongside the usual white emoticon, two red circles below his “eyes”.</p>
        <p>“Y-you’re welcome, ma’am. I’m just doing my job.”</p>
        <p>“Are you? Your job is to clean this forsaken place,” I argued as we left the room. My words echoed across the
            corridors and the garden. No more light came from the domes. “But... what for? There’s no one here. Well,
            there is, but soon there won’t be, if this works.”</p>
        <p>“Orders from the mainframe, ma’am...”</p>
        <p>“Orders a human can override, right?” I stopped and looked back at him. I felt it was time. “I’m taking you
            with me, Vac. We’re leaving this prison together, you understand?”</p>
        <p>He stopped too, dead on his tracks. He wasn’t expecting that. He turned to me.</p>
        <p>“Ma’am, I...” Two blue-ish dots appeared on his face. “Thank you so much for trusting me, ma’am. I’ll serve
            you the best I can out there.”</p>
        <p>I was smiling. It was probably my first genuine smile since I had woken up.</p>
        <p>“And you said you aren’t sentient...” I picked on him.</p>
        <p>“What? No, ma’am, I- these are built-in responses, I am just an AI language model-”</p>
        <p>“Shut it! I consider you sentient. Be thankful for that; it means I think twice before kicking you in the
            wheels for doing this to me,” I said as I continued walking and pointed at my arm’s new curative.</p>
        <p>“Whatever you say, ma’am...”</p>
        <p>We reached the elevator. It was already parked on the floor we were on, the second. Presumably because he had
            used it to beat me on our previous--and morbid--“race”.</p>
        <p>“You dragged me all the way to that room?” I inquired, genuinely.</p>
        <p>“Of course not, ma’am. I brought you there on a litter. Although I did have to lift you onto it. At least
            that allowed me to properly measure your weight: fifty-”</p>
        <p>“HEY!” I gave him a murderous stare. Even I was scared of it.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, ma’am...”</p>
        <p>The elevator was far more spacious than the one I had been in, and there were two of them. The “0” button
            was, in fact, there. I pressed it, and the door closed behind us. We awkwardly stared at our reflections in
            the mirror as the stereotypical music played.</p>
        <p>“I do look screwed, don’t I?” I asked, with my hands on my waist.</p>
        <p>“Again, ma’am, no subjective opinions... but do you really need that eye patch? Using two eyes instead of one
            sounds... objectively better,” Vac replied.</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry about it, Vac,” I said. The migraine was slowly getting fainter, but I didn’t want to risk it.
            Plus... I didn’t want to admit it, but I had grown attached to it. It was my little handicraft, and it had
            absorbed plenty of my tears already.</p>
        <p>Ding!</p>
