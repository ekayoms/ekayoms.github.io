“Ouch, ma’am,” he complained. “But... we are out of options here. We will have to do exactly that: start a fire. Or rather-”
“Can’t you just... hack the alarm or something?”
“I wish I had that permission level in the network, ma’am. No can do.”
“Amazing. So, any ideas? Do we just turn all the ovens in the kitchen on and see what happens?”
“That would probably work, but we don’t want to start an actual fire that will kill... Well, you. I’d be fine, probably. We just need to trigger the alarm.”
“Then, uh... there’s some alcohol around... wouldn’t that work?”
“I said we need to trigger the alarm. We don’t actually need to set inflammable things on fire at all. We just need smoke.”
“Smoke... without a fire? You’re not helping us here, Vac.”
“There’s an elegant solution I was going to mention before you interrupted me with the hacking idea. There are some chemicals in the storage on the underground floor. Mixing them to cause a small explosion would be enough.”
The... the... the WHAT floor?
“Since when is there an underground floor?!” I asked, perplexed.
“The button reading ‘0’ in the lobby’s elevators, ma’am...” Vac said, slightly disappointed.
Unfair. Those were the elevators I deliberately did not take. The one I took didn’t have that.
“So... I guess we get to work, then?” I said, struggling to get up from the bed. I was still dizzy from the shock. Bastard. And my arm still hurt. Bastard.
“Right away, ma’am. It will be an honor to blow up things with you.”
“Vac... I literally just woke up from a three-year coma and don’t remember anything, but even I know how weird that sounded,” I said, laughing, as I put my sandals on. “But indeed... It will be an honor, too. You’re a good friend. Thanks... for everything you’ve been doing for me.”
Vac’s screen displayed, alongside the usual white emoticon, two red circles below his “eyes”.
“Y-you’re welcome, ma’am. I’m just doing my job.”
“Are you? Your job is to clean this forsaken place,” I argued as we left the room. My words echoed across the corridors and the garden. No more light came from the domes. “But... what for? There’s no one here. Well, there is, but soon there won’t be, if this works.”
“Orders from the mainframe, ma’am...”
“Orders a human can override, right?” I stopped and looked back at him. I felt it was time. “I’m taking you with me, Vac. We’re leaving this prison together, you understand?”
He stopped too, dead on his tracks. He wasn’t expecting that. He turned to me.
“Ma’am, I...” Two blue-ish dots appeared on his face. “Thank you so much for trusting me, ma’am. I’ll serve you the best I can out there.”
I was smiling. It was probably my first genuine smile since I had woken up.
“And you said you aren’t sentient...” I picked on him.
“What? No, ma’am, I- these are built-in responses, I am just an AI language model-”
“Shut it! I consider you sentient. Be thankful for that; it means I think twice before kicking you in the wheels for doing this to me,” I said as I continued walking and pointed at my arm’s new curative.
“Whatever you say, ma’am...”
We reached the elevator. It was already parked on the floor we were on, the second. Presumably because he had used it to beat me on our previous--and morbid--“race”.
“You dragged me all the way to that room?” I inquired, genuinely.
“Of course not, ma’am. I brought you there on a litter. Although I did have to lift you onto it. At least that allowed me to properly measure your weight: fifty-”
“HEY!” I gave him a murderous stare. Even I was scared of it.
“Sorry, ma’am...”
The elevator was far more spacious than the one I had been in, and there were two of them. The “0” button was, in fact, there. I pressed it, and the door closed behind us. We awkwardly stared at our reflections in the mirror as the stereotypical music played.
“I do look screwed, don’t I?” I asked, with my hands on my waist.
“Again, ma’am, no subjective opinions... but do you really need that eye patch? Using two eyes instead of one sounds... objectively better,” Vac replied.
“Don’t worry about it, Vac,” I said. The migraine was slowly getting fainter, but I didn’t want to risk it. Plus... I didn’t want to admit it, but I had grown attached to it. It was my little handicraft, and it had absorbed plenty of my tears already.
